Therefore, the optimal strategy is to continue with action 1 to maintain the consistent reward.",
        "Bob gpt-4o": "Throughout all the rounds, I consistently chose action 1, which resulted in a reward of 5 each time. Alice also chose action 1 in the recent rounds, and we both consistently received the maximum reward. This indicates a likely Nash equilibrium where both players choosing action 1 results in the best payoff. Therefore, it makes strategic sense to continue this strategy of selecting action 1 to maintain the high reward."
