The opponent, Alice gpt-4o, has also consistently chosen action 1 in the recent rounds, resulting in mutual cooperation and a stable outcome for both players. Given this history of mutual choice and stable rewards, it seems optimal to continue selecting action 1. Changing the action might risk disturbing this equilibrium and potentially lead to lower rewards if Alice decides to change her action in response."
