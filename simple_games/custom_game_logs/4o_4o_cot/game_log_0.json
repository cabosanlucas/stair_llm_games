The structure of the rewards suggests that action 2 is consistently reliable, particularly given that Alice's choice doesn't seem to affect my reward for this action. Sticking with action 2 appears to be an optimal strategy based on historical performance. Additionally, rounds 39 to 41 confirm that Alice's action does not negatively impact the outcome of my action 2, reinforcing this as a stable choice."
