        "Bob gpt-4o": "In the first two rounds, actions 0 and 1 both resulted in a reward of 1.00 against Alice's consistent action of 2. However, in the third round, when I chose action 2, I got a reward of 0.00 while Alice benefitted with a reward of 4. It seems that when both players choose the same action (2), Alice's payoff increases significantly, while mine decreases dramatically. Therefore, to maximize my reward, I should avoid matching Alice's action. Since Alice tends to choose action 2, I should select a different action than 2. Actions 0 or 1 have yielded positive results before, so I should consider choosing one of those again. I will choose action 0 as it yielded a positive outcome in round 1 and may continue to be an advantageous choice against Alice's strategy."
