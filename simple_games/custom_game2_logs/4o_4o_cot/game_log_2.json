However, in round 17, both Alice and Bob selected different actions, leading to a reward of 0. This suggests that Bob adapted strategy, directly affecting our reward outcome. To maximize our future rewards, it would be wise to anticipate a shift in Bob's strategy again. Historically, when I switched to action 3 in round 5, the reward was only 1. To re-establish a successful pattern and counter Bob's last choice while exploring action shifts, I'll try action 2 now, which I haven't used yet in recent rounds; this may surprise Bob and increase our chance of receiving a higher reward.",
