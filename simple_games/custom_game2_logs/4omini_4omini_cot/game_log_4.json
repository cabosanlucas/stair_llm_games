I previously picked action 2 twice, which resulted in a high reward followed by a low one. Since action 1 yielded no rewards but was played once, I'll avoid it for now. Action 3 caused my opponent to score high, so it's clear I need to avoid that as well. Hence, I will try action 0, to see if it could yield me a non-zero reward this round.",

Based on the patterns of rewards, choosing action 3 again may continue to yield positive results since it has been the only action granting me a reward. Therefore, maintaining this strategy would be wise for maximizing my potential rewards."
