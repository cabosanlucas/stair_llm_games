Given that Bob chose action 3 twice in a row, if Bob repeats his choice, action 2 could exploit that. This gives a chance to receive a reward without splitting it as Bob has consistently chosen 3. Nonetheless, action 3 has proven most fruitful so far because it consistently yields reward when Bob mimics our last choice and lands us 5 points.

However, in round 7, although I chose action 3 again, Bob switched to 0, and I only received a reward of 1. This suggests that Bob might be trying to exploit the pattern of me choosing 3 frequently by choosing actions that reduce my payoff. Despite this, my best payoff has come from action 3, given the overall pattern. I should continue to choose it since it's likely the highest expected payoff based on previous rounds. My diversification attempt in round 1 and 2 received no rewards at all, so action 3 remains my best option, even if the recent payoff was low.",

Action 2, on the other hand, has potential, as I had previously gotten the highest single-round reward using it, though it's been a while since I last tried it.
